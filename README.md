## Hyperglass Setup

[Hyperglass](https://hyperglass.io/) is shipped as a
[python package](https://pypi.org/project/hyperglass/). This Puppet module
can install all the required services:

* nginx
* redis
* npm
* yarn

And hyperglass itself. It ships gunicorn as a webserver. nginx is used as a
reverse proxy.

### Examples

In case you want this module to manage all the required services, simply do:

```puppet
include hyperglass::server
````

In your puppet code. If this is a box with multiple applications, you might
want to manage the required services on your own. In this case you can do:

```puppet
class { 'hyperglass::server':
  manage_depended_services => false,
}
```

hyperglass needs a list of devices to talk to. You can pass the hash from
the docs to the `$devices` parameter. It will be converted to yaml and written
to the config file.

The same applies for the generic hyperglass server configuration (`$data`
attribute) and specific commands for the devices `$commands` attribute).

```puppet
class { 'hyperglass::server':
  data     => {...},
  commands => {...},
  devices  => {...},
}
```

An example showing devices populated.

```puppet
class { 'hyperglass::server':
  data     => {...},
  commands => {...},
  devices  => {
    'routers' => [
      {
        'name'         => 'atl_router01',
        'address'      => '10.0.0.2',
        'network'      => {
          'name'         => 'secondary',
          'display_name' => 'That Other Network',
        },
        'credential'   => {
          'username' => 'user2',
          'password' => ' secret2',
        },
        'display_name' => 'Atlanta, GA',
        'port'         => 22,
        'nos'          => 'juniper',
        'vrfs'         => [
          {
            'name'         => 'default',
            'display_name' => 'Global',
            'ipv4'         => {
              'source_address' => '192.0.2.2',
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

Please take a look at the official
[hyperglass documentation](https://hyperglass.io/docs/parameters).

It explains the three different options very well. You can pass the hashes
from the documentation 1:1 to the three parameters.

and an agent.

```bash
vagrant up
```
